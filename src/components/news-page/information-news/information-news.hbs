        <p class="">Sample setup with Gulp, Babel, Mocha and Webpack over ES6, transpiled to ES5 (source maps
            included).

            All the code, Mocha tests and config files from Gulp and Webpack are ES6.

            The is a preload bundle (to be loaded during page load time) and also a separate bundle (to be lazy
            loaded after the user presses a button).

            The lazy-loadable bundles are automatically generated by webpack and the code is just requiring
            things internally using ES6/CommonJS, making it possible to avoid AMD/RequireJS for asynchronous
            loading.!
